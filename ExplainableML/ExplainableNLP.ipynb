We will walk through the process of classifying toxic content in text using a pre-trained BERT model and then visualize which words contributed the most to the model's decision using LIME.\n",

    "This LIME output shows that the words \"terrible,\" \"You,\" \"are,\" \"a,\" and \"person\" contributed to the model's prediction with negative weights, meaning that these words influenced the model toward a certain classification (likely \"toxic\" in this case) but with relatively small impact due to their low weights. The more negative the weight, the stronger the word's contribution to the decision."

    "## Section 3: Explainability Present and Absent in a Web Application Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to explain how black-box models work is crucial for building trust in AI systems. It's important to explore how this trust can extend to other applications, demonstrating how explainability can enhance a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following music app utilizes a DistilBERT model—an efficient variant of BERT—to detect toxicity in song lyrics, similar to the model used in the earlier example. While the app successfully provides toxicity levels, incorporating explainability methods like LIME would add significant value by revealing why the model made certain decisions, offering deeper insights into how it interprets toxicity in lyrics.\n",
